Since the productivity tool is a web application, React JS and Spring Boot are viable technology choices. Here is a possible approach to building the ultimate productivity tool using these technologies:

Frontend (React JS)

Develop a React JS application to provide a user-friendly interface for the productivity tool.
Implement the features mentioned in the problem statement, such as:
Daily Focus: Create a component to allow users to set their daily focus task. This component could include a text input field for the task name, a description field, and a priority selector.
Customized Pomodoro: Create a component to implement the Pomodoro technique. This component could include a timer, a start/stop button, and options to customize the work and break intervals.
YouTube Integration: Create a component to allow users to play music from YouTube during their work sessions. This component could include a search bar to enter a YouTube URL or playlist, and a play/pause button.
Website Blocking: Create a component to block distracting websites during deep work sessions. This component could include a list of websites to block, and a button to enable/disable website blocking.
Motivational Quotes: Create a component to display motivational quotes to users. This component could retrieve quotes from an external API or from a local database.
Use React's state management features to manage the application's data and logic.
Implement routing to navigate between different pages in the application.
Style the application using CSS.
Backend (Spring Boot)

Develop a Spring Boot application to provide the backend functionality for the productivity tool.
Implement the following features:
User authentication and authorization: Allow users to create accounts and log in to the application.
Task management: Allow users to create, update, and delete tasks.
Pomodoro timer management: Allow users to start, stop, and reset Pomodoro timers.
YouTube integration: Allow users to play music from YouTube during their work sessions.
Website blocking: Block distracting websites during deep work sessions.
Motivational quotes: Retrieve and display motivational quotes to users.
Use a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store user data and task data.
Use Spring Boot's REST API features to expose the backend functionality to the frontend application.
Integration

Integrate the frontend and backend applications using HTTP requests.
The frontend application can use the backend API to perform tasks such as:
Creating, updating, and deleting tasks.
Starting, stopping, and resetting Pomodoro timers.
Playing music from YouTube.
Blocking distracting websites.
Retrieving motivational quotes.
By following this approach, you can develop a comprehensive and user-friendly productivity tool using React JS and Spring Boot.
